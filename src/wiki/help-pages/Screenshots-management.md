Here you can manage the in-game screenshots taken with a certain instance. This menu operates similarly to a file manager. You can open a screenshot by double-clicking it, or send it to a different program (such as a web browser) by dragging and dropping. You can copy a screenshot to your clipboard as an image with "Copy Image" or as a file path with "Copy File(s)". Selecting "Upload" allows you to upload the selected screenshot(s) to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/). There are also the options to rename and to delete files, via their respective buttons. Selecting "View Folder" will open that instance's screenshots folder in your default file manager.
